# Advent of Code 2021

In the spirit of sharing that characterizes Christmas and all end-of-year celebrations, I published in this repository my attempts at this year's challenges for everyone to see.

I tried to make it as intelligible as possible but I'm going for speed here so I might have cut _a few_ corners.

## Usage

If for some reason you want to run the solutions, a simple `pipenv install .` should do the trick, provided you installed pipenv sometime in the past.
Just dump your input into a file called `input` (no extension !) in the same directory as a given .py file and you should be good to go :)
